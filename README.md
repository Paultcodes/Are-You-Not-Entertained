Create a unique webpage that uses two API's, HTML, and CSS. We need to work as a group and make sure everyone makes and addition to the webpage. Our page also needs external CSS and demonstarte local storage.

### <span style="color: purple">User Story</span>
```
AS coding bootcamp students
WE WANT to create a wepage with entertaining API's
SO WE can entertain our users and learn the fundamentals of front-page development
```

### <span style="color: purple">HTML</span>
We wanted to keep the HTML simple but based off of a wireframe. We all came to a decision together how we wanted the webpage to look.

### <span style="color: purple">CSS</span>
We wanted to have a CSS style that would be easy on the eyes. So we decided to use light colors, and easy to read fonts for our CSS structure.
